## File naming

ALL CAPS = human-readable, plain-text
lowercase, executable = user interface, these are the programs that a user will run
\*.pl = Prolog code files, libraries
\*.db = Database, prolog files

## Variable and Function Naming

* Prefix internal variables and functions (used for doing formatting, debugging, workarounds, etc.) with \_.
* Use __Var__ for special variables
	* Like what?
* Keep variable names consistent
	Use:
	* `Sym` for symbol
	* `Formula` for formula
	* `Elem` for element
	* `Mol` for molecule
	* `Coeff` for coefficient
	* `Subs` for subscript
	* or `Num` if unambigous
	* `Fmt` for format
* No singletons (Use \_)
* When processing a list, try to use the pattern X, Xs where possible
	* If it is difficult use H, T (with a prefix like OutH, OutT)
* Never call a function `x`\_2, or other meaningless names --- make it clear what it does
* Use what naming convention?

* Some confusing terms: Result, Output, Value, Coeff, Vars
Make it clear what they mean:

Are these coefficients:

xH2O --> yH2 + zO2

or these:

2 * x - 2 * y
x - 2 * z


Maybe we should call the first case Vars and the second case Coeffs.

Also: All of the Rs and R0s and FinalRests. What does that even mean!!!???!!!


### Web

* `x`\_page  routes the request.
* `x`\_input defines input parameters.
* `x`\_process does the call-out to the generic code, converts it to web-usable format.
	*  We need to rename all of the `x`_do_process functions to `x`_execute (runs the program, does error-handling)
* `x`\_nop shows the prompt message instructing the user what to enter
* `x`\_html generates the page

* Avoid styling, menus, etc. in the `x`\_html pages (use a hook).
* Avoid using raw HTML (except for the formatting functions), use Prolog-y HTML --- much simpler.


## Documentation and Commenting

## Error handling, Determinism, Backtracking

1. There is a lot I do not understand.

* Exceptions seem like a good way of raising errors
	* They are clear and systematic.
	* They can be handled at the right level, and formatted for output

1. Current parsing triggers several exceptions during the course of normal operation.
	* This should never happen.
	* Avoid triggering redos. It results in a huge pile of parsing being repeated, which slows everything down.
	BAD: CH4 + O2
	1. Expression
	1.1 Formula CH4
	1.2 +
	1.3 Expression O2
	2. Expression
	2.1 Formula O2
	2.2 + FAIL
	3. REDO Expression
	3.1 Formula O2

	GOOD: CH4 + O2
	1. Expression
	1.1 Formula CH4
	1.2 Expression Tail
	2. Expression Tail
	2.1 +
	2.2 Formula O2
	2.3 Expression Tail
	3. Expression Tail
	3.1 + FAIL
	4. REDO Expression Tail
	4.1 NIL

	* We've got problems when we allow the user to enter any old sort of compound.
	- Ionic expects a metal followed by a non-metal. If it's actually covalent, we cannot raise an error.
	- We've got issues in the Formula case, as well.

2. Take a look at LEMON.
	1. It's C. It could be very hard to understand the actual actions.
	* Make it just produce a struct, suck that into prolog.
	* We've got an API.
	2. It's unnecessary to use C.
	* Perhaps a good parser is simpler to implement?
	* Performance might be better
	* Use it just to learn something.

## Indentation, Prolog

### General

* One space between different clauses for the same function
* Two spaces after a function
* Spaces around all operators
	* Spaces after ',' ';', except when used in function definitions
	* Spaces around ' -> '
* No trailing spaces

* Clause body is indented with a tab
* One line per call.
	* Excluding '!', 'fail', etc.
	* One ';' or '->' is acceptable
* Parentheses, Braces, etc, containing more than one line:
	* Space before
	* Bodies are indented with tab
	* One line per call


### DCGs

* Avoid mixing DCGs and normal clauses in the same file
* All of the product rules should be on one-line, unless it wraps
	* Then, use the General rules

* Grouping should be done based on grammatical logic
	* No spaces between very closely related rules
	* One space between rules for the same predicate
	* Two spaces between unrelated rules

## Indentation, CSS

* Braces are indented with a single space
* Rule are indented with a tab
* Always use semi-colons
* One line per statement
* Space after each rule
