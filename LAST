1. covalent_part needs error messages
2. figure out what is wrong with the crashy pure substances
3. figure out which error messages need imply and which ones don't.
4. figure out how to make the ic_acid_suffix message more clear.

5. figure out how to
	a) make the messages actually get loaded by module
		- perhaps metaprogram in two kinds of syntax stop
		like {Charge > 0} X non_metal for ordinary
		and {Charge > 0} XX non_metal for imply
	
	b) just hack up equation and word_equation to use formula and name_parse as their message namespace.

6. convert the web stuff to the new formula parser
7. abstract up the error explainer.
	a) figure out how to show these errors in prolog web.
		- rethrow with tokens and messages and let the explainer catch it???
		- rethrow and the explainer calls the right formatting functions
		- the explainer is a hook of some sort that does the right thing.
8. resolve a few unclear error messages (mostly the arrow stuff)
9. add in a few more error messages to solver.pl
10. allow checking if the user solution is valid. compounder
11. a bit more pldoc-ing.
