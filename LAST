1	[X]	covalent_part needs error messages
1	[ ]	figure out what is wrong with the crashy pure substances

1	[ ]	figure out how to

	b) just hack up equation and word_equation to use formula and name_parse as their message namespace.

1	[ ]	convert the web stuff to the new formula parser
1	[ ]	abstract up the error explainer.
