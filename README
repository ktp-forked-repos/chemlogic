## 1. Usage and Installation ##

Chemlogic comes with two interfaces: a command-line interface and a Web interface.

To run the CLI:

1. `cd cli/`
2. `./chemcli`

The CLI implements an extemely simple DSL for querying chemical information (a help message will appear when chemcli is run). It is also a Prolog top-level (shell), so you program more complicated things.

To run the Web interface:

1. `cd web/`
2. `./chemweb`

The Web interface runs on port `8000` by default, at `http://localhost:8000/chemlogic/`. The Web interface provides a simple interface for all of the Chemlogic features.

To compile the interfaces, use `make`:
1. `make <interface>`  
2. `make install`  
Run `make help` for more details.

`<interface>` is either `cli` or `web`, or `all` to build both interfaces.

The program will be installed by default to `/usr/local.` This can be changed by passing `PREFIX=<directory>` to `make` to install Chemlogic under a UNIX-style filesystem structure or by passing `DEST=<directory>` to install all Chemlogic files to the specified directory.  

NOTE: These options must be specified when running both the build and install targets, if they are run separately.

The executables built are still dependent on a copy of SWI-Prolog.

NOTE: If the `fact/` database is edited, the program must be re-compiled.  
NOTE: The Web interface will automatically search for its style files in `<PREFIX>/share/chemlogic`, or if it is not found, the current directory.


The Web interface can also be compiled as a UNIX daemon, by running `make web-daemon`

## 7. Credits ##
I would like to thank the many people who gave advice and helped with the project.

I am particularly grateful for the valuable assistance provided by Dr. Peter Tchir, my Physics, Chemistry and, now, Computer Science teacher. His help and advice, especially with algorithms and his support for my Computer Science projects helped make this program possible.
