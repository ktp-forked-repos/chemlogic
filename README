## 1. Usage and Installation ##

Chemlogic comes with two interfaces: a command-line interface and a Web interface.

To run the CLI:
	1. cd cli/
	2. ./chemcli

The CLI implements an extemely simple DSL for querying chemical information (a help message will appear when chemcli is run). It is also a Prolog top-level (shell), so you program more complicated things.

To run the Web interface:
	1. cd web/
	2. ./chemweb

The Web interface runs on port `8000` by default, at `http://localhost:8000/chemlogic/`. The Web interface provides a simple interface for all of the Chemlogic features.

To compile the interfaces (which avoids re-running `fact_dcg_translate`), use `build.sh`:

	Usage: ./build.sh <interface> <destination>

Interface is either `cli` or `web`, or `all` to build both interfaces.
The default destination is the empty `bin/` sub-directory in this directory.

The executables built are still dependent on a copy of SWI-Prolog.

	NOTE: If the `fact/` database is edited, the program must be re-compiled.
	NOTE: The `style/` directory that is created when the web interface is built MUST be in the same directory as the `chemweb` executable or the pages will look terrible.

## 7. Credits ##

I am particularly grateful for the valuable assistance given by Mr. Peter Tchir,
my Physics and Chemistry teacher, and now my teacher for the Computer Science
IDS. His help and advice, especially with algorithms and his support for my
Computer Science projects helped make this program possible.

I would also like to thank Mr. Dave Steel for letting me dismantle his computers
everyday and use his monitors.

The interest, advice and testing of everybody who tried my program or asked me
to explain it is greatly appreciated.
