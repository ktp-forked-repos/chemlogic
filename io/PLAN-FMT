The output formats work almost perfectly!

A few things left to deal with:

1. Polyatomic groups like NH4 are built once at runtime, this means they have to be in mode user. This means no superscripts.
	Ideas: One fact per mode? Slow?
		The polyatomic groups call output sub on themseleves? Really slow?
2. The output formatting should be set by the web module.
	That's easy.

3. LaTeX mode will need a wrapper. 
	We deal with it when we get there.
